# sys.raccoon literate dotfiles

This repository is an experiment. It describes my configs using markdown.

This is similar to how people describe their dotfiles using emacs org-mode and
[org-babel-tangle](https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html), but unlike them, it uses
markdown with [entangled](https://entangled.github.io/).
