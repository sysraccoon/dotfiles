# I don't use "pkill -SIGUSR1 waybar" because my custom systemd path
# automatically show waybar after conifg/theme changes (this accaptable)
# and any "home-manager switch" execution (not accaptable if waybar don't changed,
# but I not found clean solution for this, only variants "reload always on
# hm-switch/reload never on hm-switch")

# For more information about my custom hot-reload implementation see:
# $FLAKE/modules/home/tools/waybar/waybar.nix

# Also this solution allow manually restart waybar via keybinding if something went wrong
